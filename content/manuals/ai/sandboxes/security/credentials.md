{{< summary-bar feature_name="Docker Sandboxes sbx" >}}

Most agents need an API key for their model provider. An HTTP/HTTPS proxy on
your host intercepts outbound API requests from the sandbox and injects the
appropriate authentication headers before forwarding each request. Your
credentials stay on the host and are never stored inside the sandbox VM. For
how this works as a security layer, see
[Credential isolation](isolation.md#credential-isolation).

There are two ways to provide credentials:

- **Stored secrets** (recommended): saved in your OS keychain, encrypted and
  persistent across sessions.
- **Environment variables:** read from your current shell session. This works
  but is less secure on the host side, since environment variables are visible
  to other processes running as your user.

If both are set for the same service, the stored secret takes precedence. For
multi-provider agents (OpenCode, Docker Agent), the proxy automatically selects the
correct credentials based on the API endpoint being called. See individual
[agent pages](../agents/) for provider-specific details.

## Stored secrets

The `sbx secret` command stores credentials in your OS keychain so you don't
need to export environment variables in every terminal session. When a sandbox
starts, the proxy looks up stored secrets and uses them to authenticate API
requests on behalf of the agent. The secret is never exposed directly to the
agent.

### Store a secret

```console
$ sbx secret set -g anthropic
```

This prompts you for the secret value interactively. The `-g` flag stores the
secret globally so it's available to all sandboxes. To scope a secret to a
specific sandbox instead:

```console
$ sbx secret set my-sandbox openai
```

> [!NOTE]
> A sandbox-scoped secret takes effect immediately, even if the sandbox is
> running. A global secret (`-g`) only applies when a sandbox is created. If
> you set or change a global secret while a sandbox is running, recreate the
> sandbox for the new value to take effect.

You can also pipe in a value for non-interactive use:

```console
$ echo "$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" | sbx secret set -g anthropic
```

### Supported services

Each service name maps to a set of environment variables the proxy checks and
the API domains it authenticates requests to:

| Service     | Environment variables              | API domains                         |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `anthropic` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`                | `api.anthropic.com`                 |
| `aws`       | `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`                | AWS Bedrock endpoints               |
| `github`    | `GH_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`         | `api.github.com`, `github.com`      |
| `google`    | `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | `generativelanguage.googleapis.com` |
| `groq`      | `GROQ_API_KEY`                     | `api.groq.com`                      |
| `mistral`   | `MISTRAL_API_KEY`                  | `api.mistral.ai`                    |
| `nebius`    | `NEBIUS_API_KEY`                   | `api.studio.nebius.ai`              |
| `openai`    | `OPENAI_API_KEY`                   | `api.openai.com`                    |
| `xai`       | `XAI_API_KEY`                      | `api.x.ai`                          |

When you store a secret with `sbx secret set -g <service>`, the proxy uses it
the same way it would use the corresponding environment variable. You don't
need to set both.

### List and remove secrets

List all stored secrets:

```console
$ sbx secret ls
SCOPE      SERVICE   SECRET
(global)   github    gho_GCaw4o****...****43qy
```

Remove a secret:

```console
$ sbx secret rm -g github
```

> [!NOTE]
> Running `sbx reset` deletes all stored secrets along with all sandbox state.
> You'll need to re-add your secrets after a reset.

### GitHub token

The `github` service gives the agent access to the `gh` CLI inside the
sandbox. Pass your existing GitHub CLI token:

```console
$ echo "$(gh auth token)" | sbx secret set -g github
```

This is useful for agents that create pull requests, open issues, or interact
with GitHub APIs on your behalf.

### SSH agent

If your host has an SSH agent and `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` is set, Docker Sandboxes
forwards the agent into the sandbox and sets `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` there. The
private keys stay on your host. Processes inside the sandbox can request
signatures from the forwarded agent, but they can't read or copy the private
key.

Use SSH agent forwarding for Git operations over SSH and SSH-based commit
signing. The signing key must be loaded in the host SSH agent for sandboxed
commit signing to work. Outbound SSH connections are still subject to sandbox
network policy. For details, see
[Signed commits](../usage.md#signed-commits).

## Custom secrets

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Custom secrets are experimental. The `set-custom` subcommand is
> hidden from `sbx --help`, and behavior, flags, and the placeholder
> format may change.

For services that aren't in the [supported services](#supported-services)
table and don't fit the service-identifier model used by
[kits](../customize/kits.md#authenticate-to-external-services),
`sbx secret set-custom` stores a secret keyed on a target host and
environment variable name. The sandbox sees the env var set to a
generated placeholder; the proxy substitutes the real secret into
outbound traffic to the target host before forwarding.

```console
$ sbx secret set-custom -g \
    --host api.example.com \
    --env API_KEY \
    --value <secret>
```

Inside the sandbox, `API_KEY` contains a placeholder string (for
example, `sbx-cs-<rand>`). When a sandboxed process sends a request
to `api.example.com` and the placeholder appears anywhere in the
request, the proxy replaces it with the real value. The agent never
sees the real secret.

Use `set-custom` only when the service-based flow doesn't fit — for
example, when the credential lands in a request body rather than a
header, when the value is mixed with other text in a header, or
when you don't want to author a kit. Prefer the
[stored secret](#stored-secrets) flow whenever it's an option; it's
simpler and the credential shape is constrained.

## Environment variables

As an alternative to stored secrets, export the relevant environment variable
in your shell before running a sandbox:

```console
$ export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-xxxxx
$ sbx run claude
```

The proxy reads the variable from your terminal session. See individual
[agent pages](../agents/) for the variable names each agent expects.

> [!NOTE]
> These environment variables are set on your host, not inside the sandbox.
> Sandbox agents are pre-configured to use credentials managed by the
> host-side proxy. For custom environment variables not tied to a
> [supported service](#supported-services), see
> [Setting custom environment variables](../faq.md#how-do-i-set-custom-environment-variables-inside-a-sandbox).

## Best practices

- Use [stored secrets](#stored-secrets) over environment variables. The OS
  keychain encrypts credentials at rest and controls access, while environment
  variables are plaintext in your shell.
- Don't set API keys manually inside the sandbox. Sandbox agents are
  pre-configured to use proxy-managed credentials.
- For Claude Code and Codex, OAuth is another secure option: the flow runs on
  the host, so the token is never exposed inside the sandbox. For Claude Code,
  use `/login` inside the agent. For Codex, run `sbx secret set -g openai --oauth`.

## Custom templates and placeholder values

When building custom templates or installing agents manually in a shell
sandbox, some agents require environment variables like `OPENAI_API_KEY` to be
set before they start. Set these to placeholder values (e.g. `proxy-managed`)
if needed. The proxy injects actual credentials regardless of the environment
variable value.
